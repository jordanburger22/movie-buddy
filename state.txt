What is State?
- State is a way to store and manage data that changes over time.
- Each component can have its own state.
- State is mutable, meaning it can be updated.

Why is State Important?
- State allows your component to maintain and update its data.
- When state changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the new state, ensuring the user interface stays in sync with the data.

useState Hook
- In functional components, the useState hook is used to add state.
- useState returns an array with two elements: the current state and a function to update that state.
